This is my second HTML project where I built a simple personal profile page. I practiced using headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms to structure content. The page includes sections for About Me, Skills, Education, and a Contact form. It’s a beginner-friendly project to understand basic HTML layout and organization.
